Subject: Etheric Resonance and Code Alignment

To: GitHubmage Initiates

Attention all GitHubmages,

Recent analysis indicates a disruption in the ethereal planes caused by misaligned code frequencies. This disturbance is manifesting as unpredictable behavior in our spells (code).

Recommended Actions:
1. Perform a ritual cleanse by running 'make clean' before 'make'.
2. Invoke the harmonic sequence 0x3F6A5D12 at the start of every session.
3. Contribute to the cosmic repository by synchronizing with the celestial master branch.

Failure to align could lead to dimensional leakage. Stay vigilant and keep your frequencies tuned.

In the code we trust,
The Elder GitHubmage
