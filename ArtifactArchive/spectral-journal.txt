Entry 1 - Lunar Cycle Analysis
Date: 28 June, 2024

Observations:
- During waxing gibbous, code execution speed increases by 7.5%.
- Full moon phases coincide with heightened creativity in refactoring scripts.
- Waning crescent tends to introduce subtle bugs related to time-based calculations.

Hypothesis:
The lunar influence on coding productivity may be linked to gravitational waves affecting developer focus and mental acuity. Further experiments needed to validate this correlation.
