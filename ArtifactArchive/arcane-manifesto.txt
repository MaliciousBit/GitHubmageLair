----- BEGIN ARCANE MANIFESTO -----
We, the GitHubmages of the Digital Realm, hereby decree:
- Code is but a vessel for arcane incantations.
- Bugs are manifestations of chaotic energies.
- Comments are runes that guide the uninitiated.
- Debugging is a ritual to appease the binary spirits.
- Version control is the spellbook that binds our creations.
- Documentation is the grimoire that shares our secrets.

May the compilers be kind, and the tests be true.
Let the pull requests flow like a river of mana.

Signed,
The Council of GitHubmages
